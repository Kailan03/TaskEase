Client-Side:
The client-side of the TaskEase app encompasses the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) components, which can be accessed via web browsers or mobile devices. This aspect is responsible for presenting tasks to users in a visually appealing and intuitive manner, facilitating interactions such as creating, updating, and deleting tasks. Key components of the client-side include:
UI Components: This includes various screens, pages, or views that users interact with, such as task creation forms, task lists, and task detail pages. These components are designed to provide a seamless and engaging user experience.
User Input Handling: The client-side is responsible for capturing user input, such as task details and actions (e.g., creating, updating, deleting tasks), and transmitting this data to the server for processing.
Data Presentation: Data retrieved from the server, such as task lists and task details, is presented to users in a clear and organized manner. This involves rendering dynamic content based on the received data and updating the UI accordingly.
