Client-Side:
The client-side of the TaskEase app encompasses the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) components, which can be accessed via web browsers or mobile devices. This aspect is responsible for presenting tasks to users in a visually appealing and intuitive manner, facilitating interactions such as creating, updating, and deleting tasks. Key components of the client-side include:
UI Components: This includes various screens, pages, or views that users interact with, such as task creation forms, task lists, and task detail pages. These components are designed to provide a seamless and engaging user experience.
User Input Handling: The client-side is responsible for capturing user input, such as task details and actions (e.g., creating, updating, deleting tasks), and transmitting this data to the server for processing.
Data Presentation: Data retrieved from the server, such as task lists and task details, is presented to users in a clear and organized manner. This involves rendering dynamic content based on the received data and updating the UI accordingly.
Server-Side:
The server-side of the TaskEase acts as the central processing unit, handling requests from clients, executing business logic, and managing data storage and retrieval. It consists of several interconnected components

Technologies
Backend
Language: Python
Framework: Flask
Database: MySQL
Frontend
Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Framework: React.js
Trade-offs
For the backend, another option could have been Django instead of Flask but Flask is a lightweight and flexible micro-framework for building web applications in Python. It provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for developing web applications without the overhead of a full-fledged framework like Django. Flask is highly customizable and allows developers to choose their own extensions and libraries based on project requirements.
For the frontend, Vue.js could have been chosen instead of React.js. Vue.js has a gentler learning curve and simpler syntax, but React.js has a larger community and more extensive ecosystem, making it more suitable for larger, scalable applications.
Challenge
Problem
TaskEase is intended to solve the problem of organising and tracking tasks efficiently in a team or individual setting.
Limitations
The app will not solve issues related to team communication or project planning beyond task management.
Target Users
TaskEase will help project managers, team leaders, Students and individual users keep track of tasks, deadlines, and progress.
Locale Dependency
This project is not dependent on any specific locale and can be used globally.
Risks
Technical Risks
Integration issues between frontend and backend components.
Security vulnerabilities in data handling and user authentication.
Ensuring scalability and performance as the user base grows.
Non-Technical Risks
Delays in development due to unforeseen challenges or scope creep.
Lack of user adoption if the app's interface or functionality does not meet user expectations.
Infrastructure
Version Control
We will use the GitHub flow for branching and merging in our team's repository.
Deployment Strategy
TaskEase will be deployed on a custom server hosted on my personal domain. The deployment process will involve setting up the server environment, configuring domain settings, and deploying the application using a combination of server-side technologies such as Nginx.
Data Population
Initially, the app will be populated with dummy data for testing purposes. In the future, users will be able to add their tasks and data.
Testing Tools
We will use unittests for backend logic and integration tests for frontend components. Testing tools like Flask's built-in testing framework and pytest will be utilized for testing the Task Management App. These tools provide a comprehensive suite of testing functionalities tailored specifically for Flask applications, allowing for efficient unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing of the application's components and functionalities.
